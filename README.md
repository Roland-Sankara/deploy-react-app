Consider the following

- You should check your git changes (git add. , git commit)
- Make sure you are not exposing secrets, use env variables and gitignore .env file
- Make sure your app is running without errors
- Build the react app before deploying to Netlify or Vercel
- Make sure you push the correct git branch to github and raise a PR(Pull Request before Merging the code into the main codebase branch e.g main)
